Please find the below steps to configure the SSH- Password less authentication

Master Server:
1.	Created New user (Jenkins) useradd Jenkins
2.	Set the password for the same passwd Jenkins
3.	Enabled the password authentication in /etc/ssh/sshd_config Password authentication : yes (Default No)
4.	Login as Jenkin user (/home/jenkins)
5.	Generate the sshkey ssh-keygen 
6.	Validated the .ssh folder (id_rsa, id_rsa.pub) both file has been generated
7.	Changed the permission- chmod 600 id_rsa.pub
8.	Copy the public key to the destination server-  ssh-copy_id servername or IP@destination ip

Slave server:

1.	 Created New user (Jenkins) useradd Jenkins
2.	Set the password for the same passwd Jenkins
3.	Enabled the password authentication in /etc/ssh/sshd_config Password authentication : yes (Default No)
4.	Login as Jenkin user (/home/jenkins)
5.	Validated the .ssh folder – it should contain authorization_key

Validation:
1.Validated the Master server key (id_rsa.pub) using cat –cat Authorized_key
2.Validate the slave key authorized_key using cat – cat authorized_key
3.Make sure both key should be same
4.Master aurthorized key and .ssh folder shd have 600 permission 
5./home/user must have 700 permission




Test:
1.login as user
2.Try to take ssh destination server ip – ssh 10.x.x.x.
